# Frontend Test Task with WebSocket

## Syed's Forked Repo

# Instructions
- `npm start` inside emitter directory
- `cd frontend` to access frontend
- `npm install` then `npm start` inside `frontend` directory
- I've added unit tests, to test just run `npm test` while being inside `frontend` directory.
